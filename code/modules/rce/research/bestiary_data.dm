When they finally rebelled against his vision, he sealed La Manchaland from within - trapping himself and his family to prevent them from ever harming humans. Centuries of isolation left them vulnerable, and the Heart of Greed found its way inside, corrupting them one by one. Now he lies trapped deep within La Manchaland, his body slowly fusing with the Heart of Greed itself.
